# Automata
Give the productions as :
E->TA
...
Suppose there are two productions for E as in E->TA|T
then give input to the program as
E->TA
E->T

Suppose first values of E ={ ( , $ }
Give input as ($


one more thing if you wish to give epsilon production they give it as E->#
Represent Non terminals as caps and terminals as small letters.
The program doesn't take into consideration left recursion or factoring so avoid such grammars as input.
